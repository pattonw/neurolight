        If the matching cannot be done as a whole, attempt to do it piecewise.
        This has several advantages and disadvantages.

        Advantages:
            If there are many components, will at least get a partial
                solution even if one component is un-matchable.
        Disadvantages:
            Slow, requires running the matcher many times, this involves a lot
                of repeated iterating over nodes and edges to recreate the
                constraints and indicators that we have already made before
            Crossovers will fail since it is likely that the optimal route
                for both halves will share an edge in the middle.
                Solving this requires more redundant running of the matching
                algorithm.
